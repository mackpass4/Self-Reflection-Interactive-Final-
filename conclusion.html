    <h2> Self Reflection </h2>
    <p>This exercise was created to not only enable individuals to reflect upon how emotion is elicited, but also to allow individuals to reflect upon how technology elicits emotions from us constantly without us noticing it. I wanted to allow participants to take time to document how they were feeling after they experienced the interactive portion because individuals usually do not take the time to document their feelings when interacting with technology, but that does not mean those feelings don't exist. <p>

    <h3> Final notes on the creation of this piece</h3>
    <p> In order to emphasize the influence that technology has on what we see and therefore the emotions that we may experience, I decided that the best way to pick the pictures and quotes for this exercise would be to have them all randomly computer generated. This was a huge aesthetic risk, but I feel as if it was worth it to preserve the meaning of the exercise as a whole. <p>
