    <p> There will be 40 boxes, each of which will be hiding an image or a phrase. </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <p> To view what each box is hiding, all you have to do is click on it. </p>

  <div>
  <p> You will have as much time as you would like. You can click on as many or as few of the blocks as you would like. All I ask is to focus on how the images/phrases make you FEEL. </p>
